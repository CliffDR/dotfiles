# What dotfiles is Felix using

This repo contains one (maybe more in the future) dotfiles.

After I sent of this tweet I decided to move my dotfiles to GitHub. I'm still only using a very basic set of things, however I'm really happy about how much time [my aliases](https://github.com/KrauseFx/dotfiles/blob/master/.zshrc#L10) has saved me so far.
